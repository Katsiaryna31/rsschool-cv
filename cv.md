**3. Summary**

My goal is to increase my knowledge about JavaScript and change my professional field. Now I am an engineer of quality control, but I want to be a frontend-developer. I find this field attractive for myself, as I write a code and I see the result permanently in browser, I see the result of my job. Also I really enjoy study, and for me it is a strong point of IT, that I should develop my skills and improve my knowledge all time. Unfortunately at my present work I've done the same job for 3 years, that it starts to be routine and boring.

* have knowledge of basics JavaScript;
* know basic principles of OOP;
* know basic data structures;

**5. Code examples**

Every day I train in Codewars. The example of my code lower:

```javascript
function movie(card, ticket, perc) {
	var salePrice = card;
	for (var n = 1; ; n++) {
		var fullPrice = n * ticket;
		var a = Math.pow(perc, n);
		salePrice += ticket * a;
		if (fullPrice > (salePrice + 1)) {
			return n;
		}
	}
};
```
